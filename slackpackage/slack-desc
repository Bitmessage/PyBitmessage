# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

pybitmessage: pybitmessage (Send encrypted messages)
pybitmessage:
pybitmessage: Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send
pybitmessage: encrypted messages to another person or to many subscribers. It
pybitmessage: is decentralized and trustless, meaning that you need-not
pybitmessage: inherently trust any entities like root certificate authorities.
pybitmessage: It uses strong authentication which means that the sender of a
pybitmessage: message cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide "non-content"
pybitmessage: data, like the sender and receiver of messages, from passive
pybitmessage: eavesdroppers like those running warrantless wiretapping
pybitmessage: programs.
