We need to check platform and set environ for KIVY_CAMERA, if requires, before importing kivy.

We cannot use sys.platform directly because it returns 'linux' on android devices as well.
We cannot use kivy.util.platform beacuse it imports kivy beforehand and thus setting environ
after that doesn't make any sense.

So we needed to copy the `_get_platform` function from kivy.utils
