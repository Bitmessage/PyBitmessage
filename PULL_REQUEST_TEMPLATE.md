- try to explain what the code is about
- try to follow [PEP0008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- make the pull request against the ["v0.6" branch](https://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage/tree/v0.6)
- it should be possible to do a fast-forward merge of the pull requests
- PGP-sign the commits included in the pull request
- You can get paid for merged commits if you register at [Tip4Commit](https://tip4commit.com/github/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage)

If for some reason you don't want to use github, you can submit the patch using Bitmessage to the "bitmessage" chan, or to one of the developers.
