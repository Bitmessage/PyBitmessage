pybitmessage (0.3.2-1) raring; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: Remove remaining references to the old myapp.trayIcon

  * Refactored message status-related code. API function getStatus
    now returns one of these strings: notfound, msgqueued,
    broadcastqueued, broadcastsent, doingpubkeypow, awaitingpubkey,
    doingmsgpow, msgsent, or ackreceived

  * Moved proof of work to low-priority multi-threaded child
    processes

  * Added menu option to delete all trashed messages

  * Added inv flooding attack mitigation

  * On Linux, when selecting Show Bitmessage, do not maximize
    automatically

  * Store tray icons in bitmessage_icons_rc.py

pybitmessage (0.3.1-1) raring; urgency=low

  * Added new API commands: getDeterministicAddress,
    addSubscription, deleteSubscription

  * TCP Connection timeout for non-fully-established connections
    now 20 seconds

  * Don't update the time we last communicated with a node unless
    the connection is fully established. This will allow us to
    forget about active but non-Bitmessage nodes which have made
    it into our knownNodes file.

  * Prevent incoming connection flooding from crashing
    singleListener thread. Client will now only accept one
    connection per remote node IP

  * Bugfix: Worker thread crashed when doing a POW to send out
    a v2 pubkey (bug introduced in 0.3.0)

  * Wrap all sock.shutdown functions in error handlers

  * Put all 'commit' commands within SQLLocks

  * Bugfix: If address book label is blank, Bitmessage wouldn't
    show message (bug introduced in 0.3.0)

  * Messaging menu item selects the oldest unread message

  * Standardize on 'Quit' rather than 'Exit'

  * [OSX] Try to seek homebrew installation of OpenSSL

  * Prevent multiple instances of the application from running

  * Show 'Connected' or 'Connection Lost' indicators

  * Use only 9 half-open connections on Windows but 32 for
    everyone else

  * Added appIndicator (a more functional tray icon) and Ubuntu
    Messaging Menu integration

  * Changed Debian install directory and run script name based
    on Github issue #135

pybitmessage (0.3.0-1) raring; urgency=low

  * Added new API function: getStatus

  * Added error-handling around all sock.sendall() functions
    in the receiveData thread so that if there is a problem
    sending data, the threads will close gracefully

  * Abandoned and removed the connectionsCount data structure;
    use the connectedHostsList instead because it has proved to be
    more accurate than trying to maintain the connectionsCount

  * Added daemon mode. All UI code moved into a module and many
    shared objects moved into shared.py

  * Truncate display of very long messages to avoid freezing the UI

  * Added encrypted broadcasts for v3 addresses or v2 addresses
    after 2013-05-28 10:00 UTC

  * No longer self.sock.close() from within receiveDataThreads,
    let the sendDataThreads do it

  * Swapped out the v2 announcements subscription address for a v3
    announcements subscription address

  * Vacuum the messages.dat file once a month: will greatly reduce the file size

  * Added a settings table in message.dat

  * Implemented v3 addresses:
    pubkey messages must now include two var_ints: nonce_trials_per_byte
    and extra_bytes, and also be signed. When sending a message to a v3
    address, the sender must use these values in calculating its POW or
    else the message will not be accepted by the receiver.

  * Display a privacy warning when selecting 'Send Broadcast from this address'

  * Added gitignore file

  * Added code in preparation for a switch from 32-bit time to 64-bit time.
    Nodes will now advertise themselves as using protocol version 2.

  * Don't necessarily delete entries from the inventory after 2.5 days;
    leave pubkeys there for 28 days so that we don't process the same ones
    many times throughout a month. This was causing the 'pubkeys processed'
    indicator on the 'Network Status' tab to not accurately reflect the
    number of truly new addresses on the network.

  * Use 32 threads for outgoing connections in order to connect quickly

  * Fix typo when calling os.environ in the sys.platform=='darwin' case

  * Allow the cancelling of a message which is in the process of being
    sent by trashing it then restarting Bitmessage

  * Bug fix: can't delete address from address book

pybitmessage (0.2.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed Ubuntu & OS X issue:
    Bitmessage wouldn't receive any objects from peers after restart.

  * Inventory flush to disk when exiting program now vastly faster.

  * Fixed address generation bug (kept Bitmessage from restarting).

  * Improve deserialization of messages
    before processing (a 'best practice').

  * Change to help Macs find OpenSSL the way Unix systems find it.

  * Do not share or accept IPs which are in the private IP ranges.

  * Added time-fuzzing
    to the embedded time in pubkey and getpubkey messages.

  * Added a knownNodes lock
    to prevent an exception from sometimes occurring when saving
    the data-structure to disk.

  * Show unread messages in bold
    and do not display new messages automatically.

  * Support selecting multiple items
    in the inbox, sent box, and address book.

  * Use delete key to trash Inbox or Sent messages.

  * Display richtext(HTML) messages
    from senders in address book or subscriptions (although not
    pseudo-mailing-lists; use new right-click option).

  * Trim spaces
    from the beginning and end of addresses when adding to
    address book, subscriptions, and blacklist.

  * Improved the display of the time for foreign language users.

pybitmessage (0.2.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Trailing carriage return on COPYING LICENSE and README.md
