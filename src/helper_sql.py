"""
SQL-related functions defined here are really pass the queries (or other SQL
commands) to :class:`.threads.sqlThread` through `sqlSubmitQueue` queue and check
or return the result got from `sqlReturnQueue`.

This is done that way because :mod:`sqlite3` is so thread-unsafe that they
won't even let you call it from different threads using your own locks.
SQLite objects can only be used from one thread.

.. note:: This actually only applies for certain deployments, and/or
   really old version of sqlite. I haven't actually seen it anywhere.
   Current versions do have support for threading and multiprocessing.
   I don't see an urgent reason to refactor this, but it should be noted
   in the comment that the problem is mostly not valid. Sadly, last time
   I checked, there is no reliable way to check whether the library is
   or isn't thread-safe.
