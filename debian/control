Description: Send encrypted messages
 Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted
 messages to another person or to many subscribers. It is decentralized and
 trustless, meaning that you need-not inherently trust any entities like
 root certificate authorities. It uses strong authentication which means
 that the sender of a message cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide
 "non-content" data, like the sender and receiver of messages, from passive
 eavesdroppers like those running warrantless wiretapping programs.
