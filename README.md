PyBitmessage
============

Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages to
another person or to many subscribers. It is decentralized and trustless,
meaning that you need-not inherently trust any entities like root certificate
authorities. It uses strong authentication, which means that the sender of a
message cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide "non-content" data, like the
sender and receiver of messages, from passive eavesdroppers like those running
warrantless wiretapping programs.


Development
----------
Bitmessage is a collaborative project. You are welcome to submit pull requests 
although if you plan to put a non-trivial amount of work into coding new
features, it is recommended that you first solicit feedback on the DevTalk
pseudo-mailing list:
