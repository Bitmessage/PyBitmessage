PyBitmessage
============

Bitmessage is a P2P communication protocol used to send encrypted messages to
another person or to many subscribers. It is decentralized and trustless,
meaning that you need-not inherently trust any entities like root certificate
authorities. It uses strong authentication, which means that the sender of a
message cannot be spoofed. BM aims to hide metadata from passive eavesdroppers 
like those ongoing warrantless wiretapping programs. Hence the sender and receiver 
of Bitmessages stay anonymous.


Development
----------
Bitmessage is a collaborative project. You are welcome to submit pull requests 
although if you plan to put a non-trivial amount of work into coding new
features, it is recommended that you first describe your ideas in the
separate issue.
