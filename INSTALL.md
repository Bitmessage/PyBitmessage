#PyBitmessage Installation Instructions 

For an up-to-date version of these instructions, please visit the
[Bitmessage Wiki](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Compiling_instructions).

PyBitmessage can be run either straight from source or from an installed
package.

##Dependencies
Before running PyBitmessage, make sure you have all the necessary dependencies
installed on your system.

Here's a list of dependencies needed for PyBitmessage
- python2.7
- python2-qt4 (python-qt4 on Debian/Ubuntu)
- openssl
- (Fedora & Redhat only) openssl-compat-bitcoin-libs 

##Running PyBitmessage
PyBitmessage can be run two ways: straight from source or via a package which
is installed on your system. Since PyBitmessage is Beta, it is best to run
PyBitmessage from source, so that you may update as needed.

####Updating
To update PyBitmessage from source (Linux/OS X), you can do these easy steps:
```
cd PyBitmessage/src/
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
python bitmessagemain.py
```
Voil√†! Bitmessage is updated!

####Linux
To run PyBitmessage from the command-line, you must download the source, then
run `src/bitmessagemain.py`.
```
git clone git://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage.git
cd PyBitmessage/ && python src/bitmessagemain.py
```

That's it! *Honestly*!

####Windows
On Windows you can download an executable for Bitmessage
[here](https://bitmessage.org/download/windows/Bitmessage.exe).

However, if you would like to run PyBitmessage via Python in Windows, you can
go [here](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Compiling_instructions#Windows) for
information on how to do so.

####OS X
First off, install Homebrew.
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Now, install the required dependencies
```
brew install git python pyqt
```

Download and run PyBitmessage:
```
git clone git://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage.git
cd PyBitmessage && python src/bitmessagemain.py
```

##Creating a package for installation
If you really want, you can make a package for PyBitmessage, which you may
install yourself or distribute to friends. This isn't recommended, since
PyBitmessage is in Beta, and subject to frequent change.

####Linux

First off, since PyBitmessage uses something nifty called
[packagemonkey](https://github.com/fuzzgun/packagemonkey), go ahead and get
that installed. You may have to build it from source.

Next, edit the generate.sh script to your liking.

Now, run the appropriate script for the type of package you'd like to make
```
arch.sh - create a package for Arch Linux
debian.sh - create a package for Debian/Ubuntu
ebuild.sh - create a package for Gentoo
osx.sh - create a package for OS X
puppy.sh - create a package for Puppy Linux
rpm.sh - create a RPM package
slack.sh - create a package for Slackware
```

####OS X
Please refer to
[this page](https://bitmessage.org/forum/index.php/topic,2761.0.html) on the
forums for instructions on how to create a package on OS X.

Please note that some versions of OS X don't work.
